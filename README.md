## Description


### Our dream

We feel that the sheer amout of "I agree" checkboxes in our everyday lives are simply ridiculous. Our firm belief is that this problem
 can only be **solved** by the people working in the legislative. Us poor developer can't do much... Or can we?

Before a problem can se "solved" it has to be **noticed**. And I mean really noticed, with hard data behind it. That's why we build MINIPRINT
 - to collect hard data. We would like to be able to answer questions such as:

 * how many legal documents has an average European agreed to **this week**?
 * how many **pages** of fine print is that?
 * given an average education, how many **hours** would it take to read those documents, with understanding?

With such data, we hope that it will be obvious to everyone how ridiculous that "I agree" stuff really is.


### Even the longest journey starts with the first step...

The first step in achieving all those nice things mentioned above is to create a service that will provide:

 1. **legal documents in the cloud**
    A place where company employees can manage all the documents that their web users have to agree to

 2. **that famous "I agree" checkbox**
    A snippet of JS code that will render the checkbox, and allow us to keep track of the agreeing that's going on.
    For now, we're only tracking out registered users.

### Where?

You'll need a Twitter account - we made the registration process as simple as possible (both for you and for us on this hackaton :)

We also created a (very rudimentary) demo client site: http://miniprint1.tocka.tk/
